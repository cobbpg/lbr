Love Breaks Rocks
=================

Love Breaks Rocks is my small contribution to the 5th Reddit Game Jam. It is a derivative of Asteroids where you ram the rocks with your ship instead of shooting at them. The catch? You need to be charged up with LOVE (Low-Orbit Vital Energy) in order to survive the impact. The bigger the charge, the bigger the asteroid you can safely tackle.
